The **Default Filter** feature provides intelligent automation:

### Setting a Default Filter
1. Open any Scale form with saved searches
2. Click the star icon (‚òÜ) next to your preferred saved search
3. The star becomes filled (‚òÖ) indicating it's now the default

### Auto-Application Behavior
- **Page Load**: When you visit a form URL directly (e.g., `/scale/insights/2723`), your default filter automatically applies
- **Clear Filters**: After clicking "Clear Filters", your default filter re-applies automatically
- **Manual Override**: You can still manually select different filters anytime

### Managing Default States
- **Change Default**: Click any empty star (‚òÜ) to set a new default
- **Remove Default**: Click the filled star (‚òÖ) to clear the default state
- **Per-Form Storage**: Each form remembers its own default filter independently
